This is an attempt to create a good open source Minecraft Mod Manager in C++ with the ImGui Standalone template by adamhlt. It mostly uses basic C++ libraries and the Windows API besides ImGui. Also uses wget to download stuff.
Supports modded servers with UI implementation for them.
This mod manager makes all modded Minecraft profiles have their own directory for optimization and better organization.
The official Minecraft Launcher, latest Java and Java Development Kit are strongly recommended to ensure proper functioning of this program.

Full list of features:
- Automatic download of latest Fabric Installer
- Multiple modded profiles
- Adding multiple mods at the same time, as folder or per file
- Reloading profiles with a button, rather than restarting the program
- Opening the Modrinth mod page (buggy cause of Modrinth page, not a fault of this program) and the CurseForge mod page of the current mod loader and version.
- Enabling and disabling mods
- Removing mods
- Renaming mods
- Installing modded servers and accepting the EULA automatically
- Removing profiles and servers
- Managing server options
- Changing server name
- And more...
